# PhotoRights
Know your (copy)rights. This app allows writers/editors to determine whether or not a photo is safe to use for a particular type of digital use case.

I worked on PhotoRight for Startup Weekend DC: Media Edition (July 31-August 2, 2015). I built the application's front end using pure JS and jQuery, and my teammate constructed the API to ping Flickr & Instagram to determine licensing information.
