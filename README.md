# PhotoRights
Know your (copy)rights. This app allows writers/editors to determine whether or not a photo is safe to use for a particular type of digital use case.

PhotoRight was the winning project pitched at Startup Weekend DC: Media Edition (July 31-August 2, 2015). Over a 48-hour period, I collaborated with teammates to design a business model and wireframes, then built the application's front end using pure JS and jQuery. My teammate constructed the PHP API to ping Flickr & Instagram to determine licensing information.
